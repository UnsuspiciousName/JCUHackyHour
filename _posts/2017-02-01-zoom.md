# Connect to HackyHour with ZOOM Video Conference

## Join Us From Cairns ###

We want to help Cairns students too.  We'll now be hosting a group videoconference during each session using the freely available [Zoom video conference software](https://zoom.us/).

## How Do I Join In? ###

Click [HERE](https://aarnet.zoom.us/j/665639262) to join via video.

If you haven't used Zoom before you'll be prompted to download & install before joining in.

Give it a try, and give us feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/jcu-eresearch-hackyhour/JCUHackyHour/issues) or email us at <jcu.hackyhour@gmail.com>.

## Let the Hacking Begin! ###
