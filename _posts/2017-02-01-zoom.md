### Join Us From Cairns ###

We want to help Cairns students too.  We'll now be hosting a group videoconference during each session using Zoom.

### How Do I Join In? ###

Check the time of this weeks [session](https://jcu-eresearch-hackyhour.github.io/JCUHackyHour/#sessions).)  If you haven't used Zoom before you'll be prompted to download & install before joining in.
