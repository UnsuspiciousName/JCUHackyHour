### Join Us From Cairns ###

We want to help Cairns students too.  We'll now be hosting a group videoconference during each session using Zoom.

### How Do I Join In? ###

Just follow this link [https://aarnet.zoom.us/j/570625871](https://aarnet.zoom.us/j/570625871)!  If you haven't used Zoom before you'll be prompted to download & install before joining in.  Give it a try, and give us feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/jcu-eresearch-hackyhour/JCUHackyHour/issues) or email us at <jcu.hackyhour@gmail.com>.  See you this Friday!

### Let the Hacking Begin! ###
