### HACKYHOUR WENT HIGH-TECH ###

We had our first Zoom videoconference session last week, and it was awesome! There were some technical difficulties to be overcome, but we look forward to providing a smooth Zoom experience for all our Cairns based students and researchers in the future.
A big thanks to Emma for her questions about Automated Image Analysis with ImageJ.  Always a pleasure to help out researchers keen to make the most of eResearch technology.

Stay tuned here for further updates about Zooming into HackyHour.

### HAPPY HACKING!###
